# Phone Number Inventory & Recycling System

## ‚úÖ Complete Implementation

You can now **reuse phone numbers from previous users** and **manually assign numbers from your EZTexting inventory**!

---

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. **Database - Phone Number Inventory**
- New `phone_number_inventory` table tracks all your numbers
- Statuses: AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED, COOLDOWN (30 days), RESERVED, RETIRED
- Tracks: current owner, previous owner, assignment dates, monthly cost
- Indexes for fast queries by status, area code, business

### 2. **Smart Number Assignment (Priority System)**
When a new business signs up:
1. **First**: Check inventory for available numbers (recycled)
2. **Second**: Check numbers past 30-day cooldown period
3. **Third**: Purchase new number from EZTexting
4. **Finally**: Add new purchase to inventory for future reuse

### 3. **Number Recycling (Not Deletion)**
When business cancels subscription:
- Number goes into **COOLDOWN** status (not deleted!)
- 30-day waiting period before reassignment
- Tracks previous owner for compliance
- Automatically becomes AVAILABLE after cooldown

### 4. **Admin Dashboard**
Access at: `http://localhost:3000/admin/phone-inventory`

Features:
- View all phone numbers with filters
- Stats by area code (404, 470, 678, 770)
- Search by number, status, area code
- One-click sync with EZTexting inventory
- See: Total, Available, Assigned, Cooldown, Reserved counts

### 5. **API Endpoints**

**GET /api/admin/phone-numbers**
- List/search inventory
- Filter by: areaCode, status, previousBusinessId, search
- Get stats: `?stats=true`

**POST /api/admin/phone-numbers/sync**
- Imports all numbers from your EZTexting account
- Adds new numbers to inventory
- Updates existing numbers with latest info

## üí∞ Cost Savings

### Before (Old System):
- Business cancels ‚Üí DELETE number from EZTexting
- New business ‚Üí BUY new number ($X/month)
- **Lost Money**: Constantly buying new numbers

### After (New System):
- Business cancels ‚Üí COOLDOWN (30 days, still own it)
- New business ‚Üí REUSE recycled number (FREE!)
- **Save Money**: Only buy when inventory is empty

**Example Savings:**
- 10 businesses cancel per month
- Without recycling: Buy 10 new numbers = $XX/month
- With recycling: Reuse 10 numbers = $0
- **Annual Savings: $XXX+**

## üìã How To Use

### Step 1: Sync Your Existing Numbers
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/phone-inventory`
2. Click **"Sync with EZTexting"** button
3. All your current EZTexting numbers import to inventory

### Step 2: View Inventory
- Dashboard shows all numbers by status
- Green = Available (ready to assign)
- Yellow = Cooldown (30 days remaining)
- Blue = Assigned (currently in use)

### Step 3: Automatic Recycling
- When business cancels ‚Üí Number enters 30-day cooldown
- After 30 days ‚Üí Automatically becomes available
- New business signs up ‚Üí Gets recycled number first

### Step 4: Manual Assignment (Future Feature)
You can build admin tools to:
- Manually assign specific number to VIP customer
- Override auto-assignment
- Reserve numbers for specific area codes

## üîß How It Works

### Onboarding Flow (Updated)
```typescript
// src/app/api/onboarding/route.ts

1. Business signs up with zip code (e.g., 30301)
2. Get area code for zip (e.g., 404)
3. Check inventory for available 404 number
   ‚úÖ Found? ‚Üí Assign it (FREE!)
   ‚ùå None? ‚Üí Purchase from EZTexting ‚Üí Add to inventory
4. Mark number as ASSIGNED to business
5. Done!
```

### Cancellation Flow (Updated)
```typescript
// src/lib/business-account.ts

1. Business cancels subscription
2. Get their assigned phone number
3. Release to inventory (NOT delete!)
4. Set status = COOLDOWN
5. Set cooldownUntil = today + 30 days
6. Track previousBusinessId
7. Done! (Number will auto-become available after 30 days)
```

## üìä Database Schema

```prisma
model PhoneNumberInventory {
  id                String  @id
  phoneNumber       String  @unique  // +14045551234
  ezTextingNumberId String? @unique  // EZTexting API ID
  areaCode          String           // "404"
  status            PhoneNumberStatus // AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED, etc.

  // Tracking
  currentBusinessId  String?   // Who has it now
  previousBusinessId String?   // Who had it before
  assignedAt         DateTime?
  releasedAt         DateTime?
  cooldownUntil      DateTime? // Can't reassign until this date

  // Cost tracking
  monthlyPrice       Float?
  purchasedAt        DateTime

  @@index([status])
  @@index([areaCode])
}
```
