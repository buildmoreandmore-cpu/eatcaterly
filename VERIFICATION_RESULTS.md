  id           String
  customerId   String
  businessId   String      // ✅ NEW: Links to business
  menuId       String
  totalAmount  Int
  platformFee  Int?        // ✅ NEW: Your 2% fee
  status       OrderStatus
  paymentId    String?
  paymentUrl   String?

  // Relations
  customer         Customer         ✅
  businessCustomer BusinessCustomer ✅ NEW
  menu             Menu             ✅
}
```

**Schema updated with all required fields!**

---

### 3. Code Implementation: COMPLETE ✅

**Payment Routing:**
```typescript
// src/lib/stripe.ts:178-216
const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create(
  {
    line_items: lineItems,
    application_fee_amount: platformFee, // ✅ Your 2%
    metadata: { orderId, customerId, businessId }
  },
  {
    stripeAccount: business.stripeConnectAccountId // ✅ Business account
  }
)
```

**Business Validation:**
```typescript
// src/lib/stripe.ts:152-155
const validation = await validateBusinessPaymentReady(business.id)
if (!validation.isReady) {
  throw new Error(validation.error)
}
```

**Platform Fee Calculation:**
```typescript
// src/lib/stripe.ts:18-24
export function calculatePlatformFee(amount: number): number {
  return Math.round(amount * 0.02) // 2% fee
}
```

---

### 4. Security Features: IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Rate Limiting:**
- ✅ Payment endpoints: 20 req/min
- ✅ Webhook endpoints: 100 req/min
- ✅ General endpoints: 50 req/min
- ✅ Uses Upstash Redis (gracefully degrades without it)

**Security Headers:**
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ X-RateLimit-* headers

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Doesn't expose internal errors
- ✅ Sanitizes error messages
- ✅ Logs details server-side only

---

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment!

### ✅ What's Working:

1. **Payment Routing**
   - Payment links created on business's Stripe Connect account
   - Money flows directly to business bank accounts
   - Platform collects 2% automatically

2. **Revenue Collection**
   - 2% platform fee calculated correctly
   - Fee stored in database
   - Fee collected by Stripe automatically

3. **Business Validation**
   - Validates Stripe onboarding before payments
   - Clear error messages
   - Prevents payment failures

4. **Enhanced Webhooks**
   - Handles connected account events
   - Tracks application fees
   - Updates business account status
   - Handles payment failures

5. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting implemented
   - Security headers on all responses
   - Error handling secure

## ⚠️ Required Before Going Live

### 1. Database Migration (REQUIRED)

**Run this command when ready:**
```bash
# For development database
npx prisma db push

# For production database (in Vercel)
DIRECT_URL="your_prod_db" npx prisma db push
```

**This will:**
- Add `businessId` column to orders table
- Add `platformFee` column to orders table
- Add `orders` relation to business_customers table

**⚠️ Important:** Existing orders will need `businessId` populated.

---

### 2. Environment Variables (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

**For Rate Limiting (Recommended):**
```bash
# Get from https://upstash.com (free tier available)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

**Note:** Rate limiting works without Upstash (fails open), but it's recommended for production.

---

### 3. Stripe Configuration (REQUIRED)

**Update Webhook Events:**

Add these to your Stripe webhook:
```
✅ checkout.session.completed (already have)
✅ payment_intent.succeeded (already have)
✅ payment_intent.payment_failed (already have)
✅ customer.subscription.deleted (already have)

🆕 ADD THESE:
- application_fee.created (track your revenue!)
- application_fee.refunded
- charge.failed
- account.updated
- account.external_account.created
```

**Get new webhook secret and update:**
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

**1. Verify unit tests:**
```bash
npm test -- __tests__/lib/stripe-connect-payments.test.ts
# Expected: 12/12 passing ✅
```

**2. Create test payment:**
- Create business with Stripe Connect
- Complete onboarding with test data
- Create order and payment link
- Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Complete payment

**3. Verify fee collection:**
- Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/applications/fees
- Should see 2% application fee ✅
- Connected account should see payment minus fee ✅

---

### Complete Test (15 minutes)

**Follow the complete testing guide:**
```bash
cat TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

**Key verification points:**
1. Payment link created on connected account (not platform)
2. Application fee shows in Stripe dashboard
3. Business receives payment minus fees
4. Order status updates to PAID
5. Platform fee stored in database

## 💰 Your Revenue Streams

### Stream 1: Subscriptions ✅ (Already Working)
```
$35/month (Starter) or $95/month (Pro)
+ $30 one-time phone setup
```

### Stream 2: Transaction Fees ✅ (NOW Working!)
```
2% of every food order
Automatic collection
Deposited to your Stripe account

Example: Business processes $10,000/month

- Plus subscription: $35/month
- Total: $235/month per business
```
