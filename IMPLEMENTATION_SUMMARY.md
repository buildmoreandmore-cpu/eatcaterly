## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Payment Routing Fixed** 🎯
**File:** `src/lib/stripe.ts`

```typescript
// OLD: Payments went to YOUR account ❌
const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({...})

// NEW: Payments go to BUSINESS account ✅
const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create(
  {
    line_items: lineItems,
    application_fee_amount: platformFee, // Your 2% fee
  },
  {
    stripeAccount: business.stripeConnectAccountId, // Business's account
  }
)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Customer pays → Money goes to business bank account
- ✅ Platform automatically collects 2% fee
- ✅ Business gets: Payment amount - Stripe fees - Platform fee

### 2. **Platform Fee Collection** 💰
**File:** `src/lib/stripe.ts:18-24`

```typescript
export function calculatePlatformFee(amount: number): number {
  return Math.round(amount * 0.02) // 2% fee, rounded to nearest cent
}
```

**Example:**
- Customer orders $100 of food
- Platform fee: $2.00 (automatically collected)
- Business receives: $100 - $2.90 (Stripe) - $0.30 (Stripe) - $2.00 (you) = $94.80
- **You receive: $2.00 deposited to your Stripe account**

### 3. **Business Validation** ✅
**File:** `src/lib/stripe.ts:29-75`

```typescript
export async function validateBusinessPaymentReady(businessId: string)
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ Business has Stripe Connect account
- ✅ Onboarding completed
- ✅ Charges enabled
- ✅ Prevents payment failures before they happen

### 4. **Webhook Enhancements** 🔔
**File:** `src/lib/stripe.ts:374-547`

**New Event Handlers:**
- `charge.failed` - Handle payment failures on connected accounts
- `application_fee.created` - Track your 2% revenue
- `application_fee.refunded` - Handle fee refunds
- `account.updated` - Auto-update business account status
- `account.external_account.created` - Track bank account additions

### 5. **API Rate Limiting** 🛡️
**File:** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` (NEW)

**Limits:**
- Payment endpoints: 20 requests/minute
- Webhook endpoints: 100 requests/minute
- General APIs: 50 requests/minute

**Features:**
- Sliding window algorithm (accurate rate limiting)
- Distributed across serverless functions (uses Redis)
- Graceful degradation (fails open if Redis unavailable)
- Rate limit headers in responses

### 6. **Security Headers** 🔒
**Files:**
- `src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/payment/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Headers Added:**
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `X-RateLimit-*` headers (limit, remaining, reset)
- `Retry-After` header when rate limited

**Error Handling:**
- Doesn't expose internal errors
- Sanitizes error messages
- Logs details server-side only

## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Migration (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Update Prisma schema (already done)
cd sms-food-delivery

# Apply migration to production database
DIRECT_URL="your_production_db_url" npx prisma db push
```

**Schema Changes:**
- ✅ Added `businessId` to Order model
- ✅ Added `platformFee` to Order model
- ✅ Added `orders` relation to BusinessCustomer

### Phase 2: Environment Variables

**Add to Vercel:**

```bash
# Upstash Redis (for rate limiting)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Existing variables (verify these are set)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # LIVE key for production
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # From Stripe dashboard
APP_URL=https://sms-food-delivery.vercel.app
```

**How to get Upstash credentials:**
1. Go to https://upstash.com
2. Create free account
3. Create new Redis database
4. Copy REST URL and Token
5. Add to Vercel environment variables

### Phase 3: Stripe Configuration

**1. Update Webhook Endpoint:**
```
URL: https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe
Events to send:
  - checkout.session.completed
  - payment_intent.succeeded
  - payment_intent.payment_failed
  - charge.failed
  - application_fee.created
  - application_fee.refunded
  - account.updated
  - account.external_account.created
  - customer.subscription.deleted
```

**2. Get new webhook secret:**
- Copy from Stripe dashboard
- Add to Vercel as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**3. Switch to Live Mode:**
- Use `sk_live_...` keys (not test keys)
- Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Phase 4: Testing in Production

**Test Flow:**
1. Business signs up → Creates Stripe Connect account
2. Business completes onboarding
3. Customer orders food via SMS
4. Payment link created on business's Stripe account ✅
5. Customer pays → Money goes to business ✅
6. Platform fee (2%) automatically collected ✅
7. Check your Stripe dashboard: Application fees should appear

**Verify:**
```bash
# Check Stripe dashboard
- Go to Connect → Application fees
- You should see 2% fees from each transaction
- Business should see full payment in their account
```

## 💰 Your Revenue Streams (Both Working!)

### Stream 1: Subscriptions ✅ (Already Working)
```
Business pays YOU directly:
- $30 one-time (phone number)
- $35/month (Starter) OR $95/month (Pro)
```

### Stream 2: Transaction Fees ✅ (NOW Working!)
```
Automatic collection from food orders:
- 2% of every transaction
- Deposited to YOUR Stripe account
- No manual processing needed

Example:
- Business processes $10,000/month in food orders
- You collect: $200/month in transaction fees
- Plus: $35/month subscription
- Total: $235/month per business
```

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
```
Customer → Orders Food → Payment Link Created
→ Uses PLATFORM Stripe account ❌
→ Money goes to YOU
→ Business doesn't get paid ❌
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Customer → Orders Food → Validate Business Ready
→ Create Payment Link on BUSINESS Stripe Connect account ✅
→ Customer Pays
  ├─> Business gets: Payment - Stripe fees - Platform fee ✅
  └─> YOU get: 2% platform fee (automatic) ✅
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Migration Required
The code expects `businessId` and `platformFee` fields on the Order model. You MUST run the Prisma migration before deploying:

```bash
# Production migration
DIRECT_URL="your_prod_db" npx prisma db push
```

### Existing Orders
Existing orders in the database will need `businessId` set. You may need a data migration script:

```typescript
// migration script (run once)
const orders = await prisma.order.findMany()
for (const order of orders) {
  // Determine businessId from context (menu, customer, etc.)
  await prisma.order.update({
    where: { id: order.id },
    data: { businessId: determined_business_id }
  })
}
```

### Rate Limiting is Optional
If you don't set up Upstash Redis, rate limiting will be disabled (fail open). The app will still work, but without rate limit protection. **Recommended for production to prevent abuse.**
