# UX Design Audit & Consultant-Level Review
**SMS Food Delivery Platform**
**Audit Date:** October 18, 2025
**Auditor:** UX Review Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive UX audit of the SMS Food Delivery platform, cataloging existing design artifacts, identifying gaps, and providing recommendations for a consultant-level UX review.

**Current Maturity Level:** Early-stage MVP with functional UI, lacking formal design documentation

---

## 1. Wireframes & Mockups

### What Exists
**Status:** ❌ **MISSING**

**Finding:**
- No wireframes, mockups, or design files found in the repository
- UI patterns are implemented directly in code without prior design documentation
- No Figma links, Sketch files, or design prototypes referenced

**Location:** N/A

**What This Reveals:**
- Product was built code-first without formal UX design phase
- Potential for inconsistent UI patterns across different pages
- Lack of pre-implementation user validation
- Risk of design debt accumulation

### What's Needed
- [ ] Create wireframes for key user flows (onboarding, ordering, admin dashboard)
- [ ] Document current UI as baseline mockups
- [ ] Establish a design-first workflow for future features
- [ ] Create mobile wireframes (critical for SMS-based service)

---

## 2. Figma Screens & Design System

### What Exists
**Status:** ❌ **MISSING**

**Design System Components Found in Code:**
- **Color System** (`src/app/globals.css`):
  - Primary: Blue (#3B82F6, #2563EB, #1D4ED8)
  - Success: Green (#10B981, #059669)
  - Warning: Orange (#F59E0B, #D97706)
  - Error: Red (#EF4444, #DC2626)
  - Neutrals: Gray scale (50-900)
  - Background: White (#FFFFFF) / Dark (#0A0A0A)

- **Typography:**
  - System fonts: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
  - Geist Sans (custom font variable)
  - Geist Mono (monospace)
  - Sizes used: text-xs through text-5xl

- **Spacing:**
  - Tailwind default scale (0-96)
  - Common patterns: p-4, p-6, p-8, mb-4, mb-8

- **Border Radius:**
  - rounded-lg (0.5rem)
  - rounded-xl (0.75rem)
  - rounded-2xl (1rem)
  - rounded-full (9999px)

**Location:** Only in code implementation

**What This Reveals:**
- Design system exists implicitly in code but not documented
- No single source of truth for design tokens
- Inconsistency risk as team scales
- Difficult to onboard designers

### What's Needed
- [ ] Create Figma design system library
- [ ] Document color palette with usage guidelines
- [ ] Create component library in Figma (buttons, cards, forms, modals)
- [ ] Establish spacing and typography scales
- [ ] Document interaction states (hover, active, disabled, error)

## 3. User Research & Personas

### What Exists
**Status:** ❌ **MISSING**

**Inferred User Types from Codebase:**

1. **Food Business Owners** (Primary B2B Customer)
   - Needs: Simple SMS ordering, payment processing, menu management

   - Goals: Increase orders, reduce phone time, automate processes

2. **End Customers** (B2C via SMS)
   - Needs: Easy ordering, payment, order tracking
   - Channel: SMS-only interface
   - Goals: Quick ordering, reliable service

3. **Admin Users**
   - Needs: Dashboard access, menu management, customer management
   - Tech savviness: Medium-high
   - Goals: Monitor business health, manage operations

**Evidence:**

- No formal persona documentation
- No user research notes found

**What This Reveals:**
- Product built on assumptions without validated user needs
- Risk of feature misalignment with actual user pain points
- No documented user journey maps
- Unclear target customer segments

### What's Needed
- [ ] Conduct user interviews with 5-10 food business owners
