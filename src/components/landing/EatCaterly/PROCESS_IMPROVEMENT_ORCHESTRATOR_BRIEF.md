# Process Improvement Brief  
**Audience:** Lead Consultant Orchestrator  
**Scope:** Delivery performance review (Sept 26 – Oct 14, 2025) using git-derived metrics, workflow audits, and blocker analysis.

## 1. Current Delivery Pulse

| Metric (17.4 days) | Value | Benchmark | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Throughput | ~5.6 features/week | 5–10 | Healthy solo velocity |
| Change Failure Rate | 21% (6 deployment fixes / 28 commits) | <15% elite | High rework from deployment breaks |
| Commits per Day | 1.61 | n/a | Consistent output |
| Feature : Fix Ratio | 1.56 : 1 | 2–3 : 1 | Elevated fix work consumes capacity |
| TDD-Tagged Commits | 4 | n/a | Strong developer discipline |

**Trend Visuals**

```text
Throughput (Features/Week)
Week of 09-26 | ██████ 6
Week of 10-03 | ████ 4
Week of 10-10 | ██ 2

Deployment Fixes (Failures/Week)
Week of 09-26 | ████ 4
Week of 10-03 | █ 1
Week of 10-10 | █ 1
```

**Flow Gaps**
- Cycle time, lead time, and WIP are **untracked** (no board or instrumentation), preventing meaningful trend analysis or forecasting.  
- Burst delivery pattern (Sept 26 spike, week-long gaps) aligns with ad-hoc intake and absence of WIP limits.

---

## 2. Bottleneck Diagnosis

1. **Deployment Environment Instability**  
   - 43% of blockers (6 incidents) from missing env vars, Prisma generation, build parity.  
   - Impact: 3–4 hours per incident, context switching, recurring hotfix spikes.  
   - Root Cause: No staging dry-run, undocumented configuration, lack of pre-deploy checklist.

2. **Framework & Dependency Breakage**  
   - 29% of blockers tied to Next.js 15, Stripe API versioning, TypeScript drift.  
   - Impact: 4–6 hours lost; rework repeats due to absence of automated integration tests or canary upgrades.  
   - Root Cause: Upgrades pushed direct-to-prod without safeguard suite.

3. **Invisible Blockers & Manual QA Drag**  
   - No Kanban board, retro, or blocker log; TODOs accumulate (security/auth gap) without owner.  
   - Manual smoke testing requires 30–60 min per release (per START_HERE checklist) with no automation backstop.  
   - Root Cause: Missing team ceremonies (retro, planning), no Definition of Ready/Done enforcement.

## 3. Improvement Experiments (Next Iteration)

| # | Experiment | Effort | Expected Impact | Success Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **“Done Means Monitored” bundle** – Add Sentry to prod & stage, extend DoD to require dashboard check. | 1 day | Cuts post-release triage 50%; surfaces prod errors in minutes. | Alerts configured; 100% releases include monitoring check. |
| 2 | **Deployment Dry-Run Lane** – Spin up staging environment, codify 8-step pre-flight checklist and enforce before merge. | 2 days setup + ongoing habit | Drop change-failure rate below 10%; eliminate env hotfix spikes. | <10% deploys need hotfix in next 2 sprints; checklist adopted on all merges. |
| 3 | **Flow Governance Starter** – Launch Kanban board (Ready=8, In Progress=2), schedule 30-min Friday retros to review metrics & blockers. | 0.5 day tooling + 30 min/week | Builds baseline for cycle time/WIP, exposes blockers within 24–48h. | Board shows WIP compliance; retro actions closed by next session. |

Optional follow-on once above stabilize: automate integration smoke tests in CI before bumping dependencies.

## 4. Measurement Cadence & Success Metrics

- **Weekly Ops Update (Mondays)**  
  - Throughput (# items Done)  
  - Change Failure Rate (% deploys needing fixes)  
  - Avg blocker age (hours from flag to clear)  
  - Checklist adherence (% work items with complete DoD)

- **Per Deployment**  
  - Record cycle time (start → deploy) and checklist completion.  
  - Target: ≤3-day average cycle time within 4 weeks; 90% of deploys with monitoring sign-off.

- **Bi-Weekly Retro (Fridays)**  
  - Review cumulative flow / WIP breaches.  
  - Validate blocker log trends and action-item closure.  
  - Adjust WIP limits or intake policy based on observed bottlenecks.

All metrics should live in a shared worksheet or Linear/Jira dashboard for transparency and trend monitoring.

## 5. Immediate Actions Checklist

1. Stand up Sentry (or equivalent) and update DoD with monitoring sign-off.  
2. Document env variables, create staging dry-run checklist, and require its use before prod deploys.  
3. Launch Kanban board with WIP limits; schedule first retro for next Friday to review initial metrics snapshot.  
4. Begin logging cycle time, lead time (where possible), and blocker frequency to establish baseline within one sprint.
