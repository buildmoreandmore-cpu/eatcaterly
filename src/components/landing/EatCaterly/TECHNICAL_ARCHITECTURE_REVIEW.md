# Technical Architecture Review

Overall Technical Health: **7.5 / 10**  
Architecture Maturity: **Level 3 / 5** (Defined and Consistent)

The platform demonstrates solid architectural foundations with a modern tech stack, well-defined service boundaries, and clean patterns. However, critical gaps in CI/CD, code formatting, and security require immediate attention.

---

## 1. Architecture Diagrams & Service Boundaries

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial

### What Exists

- High-level architecture diagram in `README`
- 40+ API endpoints across 8 domains (customers, orders, SMS, payments, webhooks, onboarding, admin, promo)
- 12 business logic modules in `src/lib/` with clear responsibilities
- 9 database models with excellent schema design

### Service Boundaries Identified

```
Frontend (Next.js App Router)
        ↓
    API Routes (40+ endpoints)
        ↓
   Business Logic (12 lib modules)
        ↓
    Data Layer (Prisma ORM)
        ↓
    PostgreSQL
```

### Missing Artifacts

- Sequence diagrams for user flows
- Data flow diagrams
- Component interaction diagrams
- Infrastructure / deployment diagrams
- Security architecture documentation

---

## 2. Repository Structure & Code Ownership

**Structure:** ✅ Excellent (well-organised, follows Next.js 15 best practices)

```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js App Router
│   ├── api/          # 40+ API routes
│   ├── admin/        # Admin dashboard
│   └── onboarding/   # Business signup flow
├── components/       # React components
└── lib/              # Business logic (12 modules)
```

**Code Ownership:** ❌ Missing

- No `.github/CODEOWNERS` file
- No Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- No ownership matrix
- **Risk:** Solo developer knowledge silo

---

## 3. Linting, Formatting, and CI/CD Rules

### ESLint — 🟡 Configured but Weak

- Rules set to warn instead of error (allows bad code through)
- Missing critical rules (`no-console`, cyclomatic complexity, import order)
- 149 `any` usages across 118 files (0.94% — acceptable but could improve)

### Prettier — ❌ Not Configured

- No formatting enforcement
- Inconsistent code style across files
- No pre-commit hooks

### TypeScript — ✅ Excellent

- `strict` mode enabled
- Clean path aliases (`@/*`)
- Best practices followed

### CI/CD — ❌ Missing

- No GitHub Actions workflows
- No automated testing before merge
- No branch protection on `main`
- Relying entirely on Vercel's implicit CI/CD

---

## 4. Representative Code Patterns

### Excellent (9–10 / 10)

- Webhook security implementation (rate limiting, signature verification, security headers)
- Database schema design (proper indexing, enums, audit trails)
- Pure business logic functions (platform fee calculation)

### Moderate (5–7 / 10)

- API routes access Prisma directly (needs service-layer abstraction)
- Missing pagination on list endpoints
- Code duplication in error handling (15+ routes)

### Critical Issues (1 / 10)

- 🔴 **Security:** Unprotected broadcast endpoint — anyone can send SMS to all customers

---

## 5. Known Technical Debt & Fragile Modules

### Critical Debt (Fix Immediately)

| Item                             | Severity | Impact               | Effort  | Priority     |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Unprotected broadcast endpoint   | 🔴       | $10k+ fraud risk     | 4 hours | **NOW**      |
| Missing payment confirmation SMS | 🔴       | Customer churn       | 1 day   | This Sprint  |
| Missing failed payment SMS       | 🔴       | Lost revenue         | 4 hours | This Sprint  |
| Missing welcome email            | 🟡       | Poor UX              | 1 day   | Next Sprint  |

### Fragile Modules

1. Stripe webhook processing — Fragility: 8 / 10 (synchronous, no idempotency, 500+ LOC file)
2. Phone number assignment — Fragility: 7 / 10 (race conditions, manual promo assignments)
3. EZ Texting integration — Fragility: 6 / 10 (no circuit breaker, vendor lock-in)

**Total Debt:** ~2.5 weeks of work  
**Critical Path:** 2 days to clear critical security / customer issues

## High-Level Technical Health

### Strengths

- ✅ Modern tech stack — Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript strict, Prisma
- ✅ Excellent database design — well-normalised, indexed, proper relations
- ✅ Clean service isolation — 12 lib modules with single responsibility
- ✅ Type safety — minimal `any` usage (0.94%), `strict` mode enabled
- ✅ Security headers — implemented on webhooks with rate limiting
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation — 14 Markdown guides

### Critical Gaps

- ❌ No CI/CD pipeline — no automated testing, no quality gates
- ❌ Security vulnerability — unprotected broadcast endpoint (anyone can send SMS)
- ❌ No code formatting — Prettier not configured, inconsistent styles
- ❌ Missing notifications — payment confirmations, failure alerts, welcome emails
- ❌ No branch protection — direct commits to `main` allowed
- ❌ Weak linting — rules set to warn instead of error

## Refactor Priorities

### Tier 1 (This Week — ~2 days)

1. Fix broadcast endpoint authentication (4 hours) — **Critical security**
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD (4 hours)
3. Configure Prettier formatting (1 hour)
4. Implement payment notifications (1 day)
5. Strengthen ESLint rules (1 hour)

### Tier 2 (Next Sprint — ~1 week)

1. Add service-layer abstraction (3 days)
2. Implement background job processing for webhooks (2 days)
3. Add webhook idempotency (1 day)
4. Implement welcome emails (1 day)

### Tier 3 (Future — ~2 weeks)

1. Create phone provider abstraction (1 week)
2. Implement API versioning (2 days)
3. Add comprehensive monitoring (Sentry, Datadog) (3 days)
4. Create architecture diagrams (2 days)
5. Set up code ownership docs (1 day)

## Scalability & Maintainability

### Scalability Strengths

- Service-oriented architecture enables future microservice extraction
- Clear API boundaries
- Rate limiting already implemented
- Database properly indexed

### Scalability Concerns

- Synchronous webhook processing — will time out under load
- Monolithic database — no read replicas planned
- No circuit breakers for external API failures
- Tight coupling to vendors (Stripe, EZ Texting)

### Maintainability Strengths

- Clean code structure
- TypeScript provides type safety
- Comprehensive test infrastructure (Jest + Playwright)

### Maintainability Concerns

- No service layer — business logic embedded in API routes
- Code duplication across 15+ API routes
- Solo developer knowledge silo (no ADRs, no ownership docs)
- Missing code formatting enforcement

### Coupling Risks

- **High:** Stripe (used in 10+ files, no abstraction)
- **High:** EZ Texting (3 files, no provider interface)
- **Medium:** Vercel (deployment assumed, no containerisation)
