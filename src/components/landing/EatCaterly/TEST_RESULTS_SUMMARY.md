## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Payment Routing is Broken** ❌
**Current:** All payments go to platform Stripe account
**Expected:** Payments go to business Stripe Connect accounts
**Impact:** Businesses aren't getting paid for food orders!

### 2. **No Platform Fee Collection** ❌
**Current:** No 2% fee collected from transactions
**Expected:** Automatic 2% application fee on all orders
**Impact:** Missing critical revenue stream!

### 3. **No Business Validation** ❌
**Current:** Can create payment links for businesses without Stripe accounts
**Expected:** Validate onboarding before payment link creation
**Impact:** Payment failures and poor user experience

### 4. **No API Rate Limiting** ❌
**Current:** APIs unprotected from abuse
**Expected:** Rate limits on all endpoints
**Impact:** Vulnerable to DDoS and abuse

## 📋 Next Steps: Implementation Phase

### Phase 1: Core Payment Functions (Priority 1)
```typescript
// Create these new helper functions in src/lib/stripe.ts

✅ TODO: calculatePlatformFee(amount: number): number
  - Calculate 2% of order total
  - Round to nearest cent
  - Return amount in cents

✅ TODO: validateBusinessPaymentReady(businessId: string)
  - Check Stripe Connect account exists
  - Verify onboarding complete
  - Confirm charges enabled
  - Return { isReady: boolean, error?: string }

✅ TODO: getBusinessFromOrder(orderId: string)
  - Fetch order with business relation
  - Return business customer with Stripe account
```

### Phase 2: Update Payment Link Creation (Priority 1)
```typescript
// Modify createPaymentLink() in src/lib/stripe.ts

✅ TODO: Add destination charge parameters
  - Use business's stripeConnectAccountId
  - Add application_fee_amount (2%)
  - Pass { stripeAccount: businessId } option

✅ TODO: Update order record
  - Store platformFee amount
  - Keep existing payment info
```

### Phase 3: Webhook Enhancements (Priority 2)
```typescript
// Modify handleWebhook() in src/lib/stripe.ts

✅ TODO: Handle connected account events
  - payment_intent.succeeded (on connected account)
  - application_fee.created (track revenue)
  - charge.failed (on connected account)
  - account.updated (business status changes)
```

### Phase 4: Rate Limiting (Priority 2)
```typescript
// Create new file: src/lib/rate-limit.ts

✅ TODO: Install packages
  - @upstash/ratelimit
  - @upstash/redis

✅ TODO: Implement rate limiters
  - rateLimitPayment() - 20 req/min
  - rateLimitWebhook() - 100 req/min
  - rateLimitGeneral() - 50 req/min

✅ TODO: Add to API routes
  - /api/orders/[orderId]/payment
  - /api/webhooks/stripe
  - All other API endpoints
```

### Phase 5: Security Headers (Priority 3)
```typescript
// Update API routes with security headers

✅ TODO: Add to all API responses
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - X-RateLimit-* headers
```

### Phase 6: Database Migration (Priority 1)
```sql
-- Add businessId and platformFee to orders

✅ TODO: Run Prisma migration
  ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN businessId TEXT;
  ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN platformFee INT;

  -- Add foreign key constraint
  -- Update existing orders with businessId
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### When Implementation is Complete:

1. **All Tests Pass** ✅
   - 16 payment routing tests pass
   - Webhook tests pass
   - Rate limiting tests pass
   - API security tests pass

2. **Payment Flow Works** ✅
   - Customer orders food via SMS
   - Payment link created on business's Stripe Connect account
   - Customer pays → Money goes to business bank account
   - Platform automatically collects 2% fee
   - Order status updated correctly

3. **APIs are Protected** ✅
   - Rate limiting active on all endpoints
   - Security headers present
   - Webhooks verified
   - Errors handled gracefully

4. **Revenue Streams Working** ✅
   - Subscription revenue: $35/month per business ✅ (already working)
   - Transaction revenue: 2% of all food orders ✅ (will work after fix)

## 🚀 Ready to Proceed?

**Current Status:** Tests written and failing (RED phase) ✅
**Next Action:** Implement code to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for full implementation

### Before Implementation:
- ✅ Tests written for all functionality
- ✅ Tests confirmed failing (expected)
- ✅ Implementation plan documented
- ⏳ Awaiting approval to proceed with code implementation

## 💡 Key Insights from Test Results

1. **Zero Tests Passing** - Expected! We haven't implemented anything yet
2. **Functions Not Found** - Need to create helper functions
3. **Missing Parameters** - Payment links need destination charge params
4. **No Business Validation** - Critical for preventing errors
5. **Rate Limiters Don't Exist** - Need Upstash integration

This is exactly what we want in TDD:
1. ✅ Write tests first (DONE)
2. ✅ See them fail (DONE)
3. ⏳ Implement code (WAITING FOR APPROVAL)
4. ⏳ See tests pass
5. ⏳ Refactor if needed

---

**Next:** Wait for approval to proceed with implementation phase.
