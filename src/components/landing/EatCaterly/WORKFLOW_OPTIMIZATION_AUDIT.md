**Impact:**
- Slows customer onboarding
- Admin bottleneck
- Poor customer experience (waiting for activation)

**Recommendation:**
- Automate number provisioning for all tiers
- Create admin queue/notification system
- Document SLA for manual assignments

#### 2. Testing Requires Manual Steps
**Evidence:** START_HERE.md requires multi-step manual testing process
- No automated end-to-end tests for critical flows
- Manual Stripe webhook testing
- Manual database verification

**Impact:**
- Slower QA cycle
- Risk of human error in testing
- Difficult to regression test

**Recommendation:**
- Automate Stripe webhook testing with fixtures
- Create E2E test suites for onboarding flows
- Implement test database seeding scripts

#### 3. No Staging Environment Documentation

- Implement deployment checklist

#### 4. Promo Code Management Complexity
**Evidence:** Multiple test files for promo code validation
- Complex validation logic (max uses, expiration, 100% discount)
- Multiple API endpoints involved
- Edge cases require careful testing

**Impact:**
- High cognitive load for developers
- Risk of promo abuse if validation fails
- Support burden for promo code issues

**Recommendation:**
- Create admin UI for promo code management
