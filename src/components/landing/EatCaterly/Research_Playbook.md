# Foundational Research Playbook (Week 1-2)

Objective: validate inferred journeys and surface unmet needs for business owners, end customers, and admin users.

## 1. Research Goals

1. Understand how food business owners currently handle menu distribution and SMS workflows.
2. Evaluate onboarding + plan selection usability (task completion, comprehension).
3. Gauge trust/confidence in SMS payment experience for end customers.
4. Identify daily operational gaps in admin dashboard for staff.

## 2. Participant Segments

| Segment | Profile | Recruits | Screener Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business Owner | Independent restaurant/catering lead offering delivery/catering | 5 | Sends menus manually today, uses SMS or WhatsApp |
| Admin Staff | Ops manager managing orders/reservations | 3 | Familiar with spreadsheets/CRMs |
| End Customer | Regular catering/employer lunch recipient | 3 | Has paid via SMS/text link before |

Recruit via existing customer list + local food entrepreneur communities. Incentive: $75 gift card / session.

## 3. Method Mix

- **Semi-structured interviews (45 min)** with owners/admins (remote via Zoom). Focus on workflows, pain points, expectations.
- **Task-based usability tests (30 min)** using current build or prototype:
  - Owner: Sign up, apply promo, select plan, reach dashboard.
  - Admin: Create menu, send broadcast, review orders.
  - Customer: (moderated simulation) interpret SMS menu screenshot, follow payment link, confirm order.
- **Follow-up survey** collecting satisfaction scores, biggest friction point, desired improvements.

## 4. Discussion Guide (Interview)

1. Background & context (business size, channels used).
2. Current process for sending menus & collecting orders.
3. Perception of SMS as ordering channel (trust, challenges).
4. Reaction to EatCaterly value proposition (show landing hero).
5. Walkthrough of onboarding flow (screen share); probe confusion.
6. Evaluate pricing page and promo handling.
7. Explore dashboard expectations (metrics, actions).
8. Closing: biggest blockers + must-have improvement.

## 5. Metrics & Capture

- Task success (binary) + severity rating (0-4) per issue.
- Time on task (start/stop timer).
- Confidence rating (1-5 Likert).
- SUS (System Usability Scale) after session.
- Screen/video recording with consent; store notes in shared doc.

## 6. Analysis Plan

1. Affinity map qualitative notes (pain/gain patterns).
2. Cluster issues by flow (landing, onboarding, admin) and severity.
3. Update personas with fresh insights (motivation, barriers).
4. Feed findings into design backlog with impact/effort tagging.

## 7. Logistics & Tools

- Scheduling: Calendly or manual calendar + reminders (48h, 2h).
- Recording: Zoom/Meet cloud recording, backup OBS if needed.
- Documentation: Notion/Google Doc for live note-taking, Miro for affinity mapping.
- NDA/Consent: Send lightweight consent form covering recording usage.

## 8. Timeline

| Day | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Finalize screener, outreach emails, confirm incentives |
| 2-4 | Recruit participants, schedule sessions |
| 5-8 | Conduct interviews/usability sessions (2 per day) |
| 9 | Synthesize findings, create opportunity areas |
| 10 | Share readout with product/design/engineering |

This playbook enables immediate execution once stakeholder approval and scheduling bandwidth are secured.
